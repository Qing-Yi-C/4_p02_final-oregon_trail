## Project Description
Provide a high-level description of your project. Include explanatory links if you think they will be helpful.
- We will recreate the retro "Oregon Trail" game which is a choice driven/story progression game. The player is the leader of a group of 5 that will travel from Missouri to Oregon along the Oregon Trail. The user will name the five characters and start the game in a town. 
- In the real game, there are 16 segments along the trail that the player will stop at and have interaction choices at, but because of user boredom and time constraints, our game will have fewer segments, fewer interactions at each stop, and only two party members named Aaa and Bee.
- At the beginning of the game and at certain stops like forts, the user will be able to buy supplies for the rest of their journey: food and  oxen. Over the course of the trail, there will be misfortunes like disease, loss of supplies from river travel, and even death of party members from starvation or dysentery.
- Along the trail, there will be stops like forts and obstacles like rivers that the player can choose how to cross. For rivers, you could attempt to ford (wading/walking across) the river, spend a few days to caulk (waterproof) the wagon and float it across similar to floating a boat across, or wait a few days and pay a fee to take a ferry with your wagon. Depending on the depth/width of the river, the success of crossing the river will differ.
- As the days progress through the game either through travel, rest, or river crossing, food will be consumed. Also, because the trail is tough and the user can change the speed of travel, the amount of health lost per day will differ depending on how fast the crew is going.

## Class Topic Usage
Explain what topics from this year you will be using in this project, and how they will be used.
- We will use image processing to display images of each scene, landmark, obstacle, loading screen, etc. and images of the wagon and oxen as the player walks along the trail. We also plan to display a lot of information such as wallet, food, and health.
- We will use A LOT of keyboard input because this game is very dependent on the user's choices. In the real game, most of the inputs are the user typing a specific number for certain choices/quantities they would like or answering yes/no.
- Many conditional statements for keyboard inputs, identitfying what segment the player is at, and moving along segments to progress the story.

## Libraries (optional)
If you are using any processing libraries, list them and explain why you need them.
- N/A

## Classes
1) Animation: animate/loop the frames of the gif of the oxen and wagon moving
5) Choice: will be the base to make each of the choice lists; each type of choice list will have different choices for different scenarios and a different number of choices

## Keyboard Commands
1) enter key: if user goes through the mini tutorial/lesson in the intro, they use enter to progress through the slides
3) r: reset the entire game
4) numbers 1-5: choose what to do at each stop (ex. continuing, resting, buying supplies, changing speed, changing rations, river stuff, etc.)
